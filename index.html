                My Dearest, Iffah,<br><br>
                Happy 20th Birthday, my love! 🎉 I couldn’t really do much for your last birthday since it was a surprise to me, so I wanted this one to be extra special for you, just like how you always make me feel. ❤️<br><br>
		You light up my life in ways I never thought were possible. Thank you for everything you’ve done for me so far, and for putting up with all my weird behaviors and accepting me with all my flaws. 
		I truly appreciate having you in my life.<br><br>
		I know we have our ups and downs in this relationship, but I believe we can push through anything together, no matter how hard it gets, cause I truly want it to be you in the end, 
		I want to spend the rest of my life with you.<br><br>
		I understand that no gift I give you can ever truly repay the gift of having you in my life and watching you grow alongside me. So, I hope this year brings you all the happiness you deserve. 
		I’ll always be right here cheering you on through every step of your journey.<br><br>
                I hope today is filled with love, laughter, and joy, just like the happiness you bring me.<br><br>
                <br><br>
                With all my love,<br>Your Baby Boy, Muhammed.
